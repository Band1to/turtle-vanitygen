# Work in Progress

This repository contains Nim wrappers over a few of the cryptonote
cryptographic primatives and some address handling procedures.

The wrappers are used to for a vanity address generator for [TurtleCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol/).
Almost all of this repository is based on @ehmry's [nim-monero](https://github.com/ehmry/nim-monero).

## Building
Clone the repository and run ``nimble build``.
